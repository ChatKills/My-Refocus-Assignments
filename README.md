My name is Marc, I am an aspiring web developer who started studying 4 months ago. I have made great strides learning but I know there is still much to learn and experience.

My hobbies include watching youtube videos, reading online novels and looking at codes and coding.

My goal for this year is finish my courses and learn as much as I can.

My reason for wanting to be a web dev is it enables me to follow my passions and make me happy.
